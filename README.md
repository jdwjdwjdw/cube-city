Cube City Game

# Cube, the Obstacle Avoiding Cube Game!

Basic Cube game created while completing Brackey's awesome ["How to make a Video Game"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL) Unity learning series on youtube.

## Instructions
### Levels 1-3
For the first three levels, your goal is to avoid the obstcales!

#### Controls
A: move left

D: move right

### Level 4 (experimental level)
Level 4 is an experimental level, just for fun! Here, you can fly around, speed up, and hit all the obstacles you want!

#### Controls
A: move left

D: move right

W: move up

S: Slow down

Space: speed up

## Setup tips
Due to browser security settings, opening up index.html in a browser will most likely not work, as it will be a localhost.

One easy way around this is to download the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) VS Code extension, and run index.html there.

Or just skip setup entirely, and play on my [Github Pages](https://jdwjdwjdw.github.io/cube-city/) ;)

Have a wonderful day, and here's to more Unity learning ahead!
